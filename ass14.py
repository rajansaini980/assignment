#Q.1- Write a Python program to read last n lines of a file
#Ans-
#n=int(input("ENTER THT VALUE HOW MUCH LINES U WANT TO PRINT "))
# c=0
# f=open('abc.txt','r',encoding='utf8')
# content=f.readlines()
# #print(content)
# for i in content:
#     c=c+1
#     if(c>n):
#       print(i)
# f.close

#Q.2 Write a Python program to count the frequency of words in a file.
#Ans-


# with open("abc.txt",'r') as f:
#     content = f.read()
#
# words = content.split()
# print(words)
# s = set(words)
# print(s)
# for n in s:
#     print(n,words.count(n))


# Q.3- Write a Python program to copy the contents of a file to another file
#Ans-

# with open ('abc.txt','r') as f1:
#     with open('cde.txt','w') as f2:
#         for line in f1:
#             f2.write(line)

# Q.4- Write a Python program to combine each line
# from first file with the corresponding line in
# second file.
#Ans-
# with open ('abc.txt','r') as f1:
#      con1=f1.readlines()
#
# with open('cde.txt', 'r') as f2:
#     con2 =f2.readlines()
#
# i = 0
# for n in con1:
#     print(con1[i]+con2[i])
#     i = i + 1
# Q.5- Write a Python program to write 10 random
# numbers into a file. Read the file and then sort
# the numbers and then store it to another file.
#Ans-
# import random
# with open ('abc.txt','w') as f1:
#  for i in range(10):
#   num=random.randint(1,9)
#   f1.write(str(num))
#   f1.write("\n")
# with open ('abc.txt','r') as f1:
#     con=f1.readlines()
#     con.sort()
#
# with open ('cde.txt','w') as f1:
#  for i in con:
#      f1.write(i)
#      f1.write('\n')
